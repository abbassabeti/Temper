## Depedencies

This App uses:

To find out more about how to run the app, see Installation instructions below.

## Installation

To run the app, you need to clone it and then, use below command in the root folder of project

```ruby
pod install
```

And Finally, run the app. As it can be seen from the above screenshots, there is a single tableview with support for pull-to-refresh and Diffable dataSource in the app.

I also have written some UnitTests for the logic parts of the app which is available under a sub project, named BitPandaUnitTests in the main project.
